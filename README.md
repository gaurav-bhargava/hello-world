Adding a Brief Description about India. 

India also known as Hindustan, Bharat is an ancient country with very rich and glorious past. The home to ancient science and research, the land of gold and spices, the land of spiritual upliftment and the land of Yoga.  

Second Edit to the hello-world on 26-Jan where India celebrates its Republic Day with Pomp and pride.
